DSI Studio, linux version

Installation instructions

DISCLAIMER: 
this how-to was written while installing DSI Studio on an Ubuntu 12.04 64bit 
system with nVidia drivers downloaded directly from nvidia site. 
Hopefully soon, we will have the time to test it on other linux distributions.

Thank you for your patience.

1) If you are using standard nVidia drivers that comes with your Ubuntu 
   distribution, you can use standard qmake and qt libraries coming with 
   ubuntu.

 1.1) install qmake, qt tools and libraries

> sudo apt-get install qt4-qmake qt4-dev-tools

      This should install all the needed dependencies

 1.2) skip to step 3

2) If you are using custom installed nvidia drivers downloaded directly 
   from nvidia website, we need to custom compile qt and link it to the 
   nvidia libraries that are installed by the nvidia package. If you use 
   the standard qt package, qt will be linked to the standard libraries 
   and dsi studio will through an error, most likely at compilation time, 
   because version of the open-gl libraries that it expects and the one 
   available are different.
 2.1) Prepare system to install qt libraries. We need to install some 
      dependencies for qt to be able to compile (please refer to the 
      following URL for more info: 
- http://www.qtforum.org/article/27401/debian-xlib-test-failed-after-configure.html)

> sudo apt-get build-dep qt4-qmake

 2.2) visit qt page to figure out the latest version of qt 
      (version 4.8.2 at the time of this writing):

- http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/linux-x11-cpp

 2.3) download tar file:

> wget http://releases.qt-project.org/qt4/source/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.2.tar.gz

 2.4) expand and get ready to compile

> tar xvzf qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.2.tar.gz
> cd qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.2

 2.5) configure step. We place all our custom compiled package under 
      /usr/local/pkg. You can change the location anyway you like, 
      as long as you change the qmake alias path accordingly. 
      Webkit has been excluded because, apparently, does not play well
      with Ubuntu 12.04 and the version of gcc coming with it.

> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/pkg/qt/4.8.2 -no-webkit

 2.6) compile

> make

 2.7) install 

> sudo make install

 2.8) create qmake alias

> alias qmake=”/usr/local/pkg/qt/4.8.2/bin/qmake”

3) install dependencies for dsi-studio

> sudo apt-get install git
> sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
> sudo apt-get install zlib1g zlib1g-dev

4) create working folder

> mkdir dsistudio
> cd dsistudio

5) download source code from git

> git clone -b linux_dev git://github.com/frankyeh/DSI-Studio.git src

6) there is no need to download additional libraries as stated in the original 
   readme.txt file. They have been included in the linux version after being 
   revised to work with gcc on 64 bits platform. The author approved it.
   If you are looking to use them in other project, please download them from 
   the main repositories. Be aware that they have been modified to be able to 
   work within dsi studio.
   Here are the links to their main repositories

   - Matrix: http://gmo.labsolver.org/download/matrix_op.hpp?attredirects=0&d=1
   - TMLL: https://github.com/frankyeh/TMLL/zipball/master

7) create build folder

> mkdir build
> cd build

8) configure step

> qmake ../src

9) compile step

> make

10) install step

> sudo mkdir /usr/local/pkg/dsistudio/20120919
> sudo cp dsi_studio /usr/local/pkg/dsistudio/20120919/dsi_studio

11) FA file. DSI Studio needs a template image file called FMRIB58_FA_1mm.nii. 
    If you do not make it available, DSI Studio will not open with the error 
    “FA template file not found”. 
    It still unclear where you can download this file from. We have many copies 
    on our servers, so I have not spent any time to track it down as of now.

 11.1) create repository for the file

> sudo mkdir /usr/local/pkg/dsistudio/templates

 11.2) move the file in there

 11.3) define environmental variable to provide path:

> export DSI_STUDIO_FA_TEMPLATE=/usr/local/pkg/dsi_studio/20120516/FMRIB58_FA_1mm.nii

12) Create alias to run dsi studio

> alias dsistudio=”/usr/local/pkg/dsistudio/20120919/dsi_studio”


Feedback is appreciated.
