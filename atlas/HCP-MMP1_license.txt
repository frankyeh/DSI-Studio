WU-Minn HCP Consortium Open-Access Data Use Terms
I request access to de-identified open access data collected by the Washington University - University
of Minnesota Consortium of the Human Connectome Project (WU-Minn HCP), and I agree to the
following:
1. I will not attempt to establish the identity of or attempt to contact any of the included human subjects.
2. I understand that under no circumstances will the code that would link these data to Protected Health
Information be given to me, nor will any additional information about individual human subjects be released to
me under these Data Use Terms.
3. I will comply with all relevant rules and regulations imposed by my institution.
4. I may redistribute original WU-Minn HCP Open Access data and any derived data as long as the data are
redistributed under the Data Use Terms stipulated in sections 1, 2, 3, and 5 of this document.
5. I will acknowledge the use of WU-Minn HCP data and data derived from WU-Minn HCP data when publicly
presenting any results or algorithms that benefitted from their use.
a. Papers, book chapters, books, posters, oral presentations, and all other printed and digital
presentations of results derived from HCP data should contain the following wording in the
acknowledgments section: "Data were provided [in part] by the Human Connectome Project, WU-Minn
Consortium (Principal Investigators: David Van Essen and Kamil Ugurbil; 1U54MH091657) funded by
the 16 NIH Institutes and Centers that support the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research; and by
the McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience at Washington University."
b. Authors of publications or presentations using WU-Minn HCP data should cite relevant publications
describing the methods used by the HCP to acquire and process the data. The specific publications
that are appropriate to cite in any given study will depend on what HCP data were used and for what
purposes. An annotated and appropriately up-to-date list of publications that may warrant
consideration is available at http://www.humanconnectome.org/about/acknowledgehcp.html
c. The WU-Minn HCP Consortium as a whole should not be included as an author of publications or
presentations if this authorship would be based solely on the use of WU-Minn HCP data.
6. Failure to abide by these guidelines will result in termination of my privileges to access WU-Minn HCP data.
